## Repository Structure

This repository contains multiple implementations of Conway’s Game of Life, organized by branch:

- **`main`**  
  Baseline serial C implementation.

- **`openmp`**  
  OpenMP-parallelized implementation.

- **`sortl005/CUDA`**  
  CUDA-based GPU implementation.

Each branch contains its own build and run instructions.

## Attribution

The baseline C implementation is a fork of existing work. We made small modifications to improve correctness and to support larger test sizes. All OpenMP and CUDA parallelization work was implemented by the project team.
